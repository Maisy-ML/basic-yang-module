--- abstract

This document defines YANG RPCs and a small number of configuration nodes required to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity measurements from a device, following the operational context defined in TPM-based Network Device Remote Integrity Verification. Complementary measurement logs are also provided by the YANG RPCs, originating from one or more roots of trust for measurement (RTMs). The module defined requires at least one TPM 1.2 or TPM 2.0 as well as a corresponding TPM Software Stack (TSS), included in the device components of the composite device the YANG server is running on.

# Introduction

This document is based on the general terminology defined in the {{-rats-architecture}} and uses the operational context defined in {{-RIV}} as well as the interaction model and information elements defined in {{-rats-interaction-models}}. The currently supported hardware security modules (HSMs) are the Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) {{TPM1.2}} and {{TPM2.0}} as specified by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). One or more TPMs embedded in the components of a Composite Device are required in order to use the YANG module defined in this document. A TPM is used as a root of trust for reporting (RTR) in order to retrieve attestation Evidence from a composite device (*TPM Quote* primitive operation). Additionally, it is used as a root of trust for storage (RTS) in order to retain shielded secrets and store system measurements using a folding hash function (*TPM PCR Extend* primitive operation).

Specific terms imported from {{-rats-architecture}} and used in this document include: Attester, Composite Device, Evidence.

Specific terms imported from {{TPM2.0-Key}} and used in this document include: Endorsement Key (EK), Initial Attestation Key (IAK), Local Attestation Key (LAK).

## Requirements notation

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# The YANG Module for Basic Remote Attestation Procedures

One or more TPMs MUST be embedded in a Composite Device that provides attestation evidence via the YANG module defined in this document. The ietf-basic-remote-attestation YANG module enables a composite device to take on the role of an Attester, in accordance with the Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture {{-rats-architecture}}, and the corresponding challenge-response interaction model defined in the {{-rats-interaction-models}} document. A fresh nonce with an appropriate amount of entropy {{NIST-915121}} MUST be supplied by the YANG client in order to enable a proof-of-freshness with respect to the attestation Evidence provided by the Attester running the YANG datastore. Further, this nonce is used to prevent replay attacks. The method for communicating the relationship of each individual TPM to specific measured component within the Composite Device is out of the scope of this document.

## YANG Modules

In this section the several YANG modules are defined.

### 'ietf-tpm-remote-attestation'

This YANG module imports modules from {{-ietf-yang-types}}, {{-ietf-hardware}}, {{-ietf-keystore}}, and `ietf-tcg-algs.yang` {{ref-ietf-tcg-algs}}.

#### Features

This module supports the following features:

- 'TPMs': Indicates that multiple TPMs on the device can support remote attestation. This feature is applicable in cases where multiple line cards are present, each with its own TPM.

- 'bios': Indicates that the device supports the retrieval of BIOS/UEFI event logs. {{bios-log}}

- 'ima': Indicates that the device supports the retrieval of event logs from the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA). {{ima-log}}

- 'netequip_boot': Indicates that the device supports the retrieval of netequip boot event logs.  {{netequip-boot-log}}

#### Identities

This module supports the following types of attestation event logs: 'bios', 'ima', and 'netequip_boot'.

#### Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)

In the following, RPCs for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 attestation procedures are defined.

##### 'tpm12-challenge-response-attestation'

This RPC allows a Verifier to request signed TPM PCRs (*TPM Quote* operation) from a TPM 1.2 compliant cryptoprocessor. Where the feature 'TPMs' is active, and one or more 'certificate-name' is not provided, all TPM 1.2 compliant cryptoprocessors will respond.  A YANG tree diagram of this RPC is as follows:

~~~ TREE
{::include-dedent tpm12-challenge-response-attestation.tree}
~~~

##### 'tpm20-challenge-response-attestation'

This RPC allows a Verifier to request signed TPM PCRs (*TPM Quote* operation) from a TPM 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessor. Where the feature 'TPMs' is active, and one or more 'certificate-name' is not provided, all TPM 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessors will respond. A YANG tree diagram of this RPC is as follows:

~~~ TREE
{::include-dedent tpm20-challenge-response-attestation.tree}
~~~

An example of an RPC challenge requesting PCRs 0-7 from a SHA-256 bank could look like the following:

~~~
<rpc message-id="101" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <tpm20-challenge-response-attestation>
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tpm-remote-attestation">
    <certificate-name>
      (identifier of a TPM signature key with which the Verifier is
      supposed to sign the attestation data)
    </certificate-name>
    <nonce>
      0xe041307208d9f78f5b1bbecd19e2d152ad49de2fc5a7d8dbf769f6b8ffdeab9
    </nonce>
    <tpm20-pcr-selection>
      <tpm20-hash-algo
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tcg-algs">
        TPM_ALG_SHA256
      </tpm20-hash-algo>
      <pcr-index>0</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>1</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>2</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>3</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>4</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>5</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>6</pcr-index>
      <pcr-index>7</pcr-index>
    </tpm20-pcr-selection>
  </tpm20-challenge-response-attestation>
</rpc>
~~~

A successful response could be formatted as follows:

~~~
<rpc-reply message-id="101"
  xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <tpm20-attestation-response
    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-tpm-remote-attestation">
    <certificate-name
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-keystore">
        (instance of Certificate name in the Keystore)
    </certificate-name>
    <attestation-data>
       (raw attestation data, i.e. the TPM quote; this includes
       a composite digest of requested PCRs, the nonce,
       and TPM 2.0 time information.)
    </attestation-data>
    <quote-signature>
        (signature over attestation-data using the TPM key
        identified by sig-key-id)
    </quote-signature>
  </tpm20-attestation-response>
</rpc-reply>
~~~

#### 'log-retrieval'

This RPC allows a Verifier to acquire the evidence which was extended into specific TPM PCRs. A YANG tree diagram of this RPC is as follows:

~~~ TREE
{::include-dedent log-retrieval.tree}
~~~

#### Data Nodes

This section provides a high level description of the data nodes containing the configuration and operational objects with the YANG model. For more details, please see the YANG model itself in {{ref-ietf-tpm-remote-attestation}}.

Container 'rats-support-structures':

: This houses the set of information relating to a device's TPM(s).

Container 'tpms':

: Provides configuration and operational details for each supported TPM, including the tpm-firmware-version, PCRs which may be quoted, certificates which are associated with that TPM, and the current operational status. Of note are the certificates which are associated with that TPM. As a certificate is associated with a particular TPM attestation key, knowledge of the certificate allows a specific TPM to be identified.

~~~ TREE
{::include-dedent tpms.tree}
~~~

container 'attester-supported-algos' - Identifies which TCG hash algorithms are available for use on the Attesting platform. This allows an operator to limit algorithms available for use by RPCs to just a desired set from the universe of all allowed hash algorithms by the TCG.

~~~ TREE
{::include-dedent attester-supported-algos.tree}
~~~

container 'compute-nodes' - When there is more than one TPM supported, this container maintains the set of information related to the compute node associated with a specific TPM. This allows each specific TPM to identify to which 'compute-node' it belongs.

~~~ TREE
{::include-dedent compute-nodes.tree}
~~~

### 'ietf-tcg-algs'

Cryptographic algorithm types were initially included within -v14 NETCONF's iana-crypto-types.yang.  Unfortunately, all this content including the algorithms needed here failed to make the -v15 used WGLC. As a result, this document has encoded the TCG Algorithm definitions of {{TCG-Algos}}, revision 1.32. By including this full table as a separate YANG file within this document, it is possible for other YANG models to leverage the contents of this model.

#### Features

There are two types of features supported: 'TPM12' and 'TPM20'. Support for either of these features indicates that a cryptoprocessor supporting the corresponding type of TCG TPM API is present on an Attester. Most commonly, only one type of cryptoprocessor will be available on an Attester.

#### Identities

There are three types of identities in this model:

1. **Cryptographic functions** supported by a TPM algorithm; these include: 'asymmetric', 'symmetric', 'hash', 'signing', 'anonymous_signing', 'encryption_mode', 'method', and 'object_type'. The definitions of each of these are in Table 2 of {{TCG-Algos}}.

2. **API specifications** for TPMs: 'tpm12' and 'tpm20'

3. **Specific algorithm types**: Each algorithm type defines what cryptographic functions may be supported, and on which type of API specification. It is not required that an implementation of a specific TPM will support all algorithm types. The contents of each specific algorithm mirrors what is in Table 3 of {{TCG-Algos}}.

{: #ref-ietf-tcg-algs}

#### YANG Module

~~~~ YANG
<CODE BEGINS> file "ietf-tcg-algs@2021-11-05.yang"
{::include-dedent ietf-tcg-algs@2021-11-05.yang}
<CODE ENDS>
~~~~

Note that not all cryptographic functions are required for use by `ietf-tpm-remote-attestation.yang`. However the full definition of Table 3 of {{TCG-Algos}} will allow use by additional YANG specifications.

# Security Considerations

The YANG module ietf-tpm-remote-attestation.yang specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF {{RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{RFC6242}}.  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS {{RFC8446}}.

There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., *config true*, which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., *edit-config*) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes as well as their sensitivity/vulnerability:

Container '/rats-support-structures/attester-supported-algos':

: 'tpm12-asymmetric-signing', 'tpm12-hash', 'tpm20-asymmetric-signing', and 'tpm20-hash'. All could be populated with algorithms that are not supported by the underlying physical TPM installed by the equipment vendor.

Container: '/rats-support-structures/tpms':

: 'name': Although shown as 'rw', it is system generated. Therefore it should not be possible for an operator to add or remove a TPM from the configuration.

: 'tpm20-pcr-bank': It is possible to configure PCRs for extraction which are not being extended by system software.  This could unnecessarily use TPM resources.

: 'certificates': It is possible to provision a certificate which does not correspond to an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) within the TPM 1.2, or an Attestation Key (AK) within the TPM 2.0 respectively.

RPC 'tpm12-challenge-response-attestation':

: It must be verified that the certificate is for an active AIK, i.e., the certificate provided is able to support Attestation on the targeted TPM 1.2.

RPC 'tpm20-challenge-response-attestation':

: It must be verified that the certificate is for an active AK, i.e., the certificate provided is able to support Attestation on the targeted TPM 2.0.

RPC 'log-retrieval':

: Requesting a large volume of logs from the attester could require significant system resources and create a denial of service.


Information collected through the RPCs above could reveal that specific versions of software and configurations of endpoints that could identify vulnerabilities on those systems.  Therefore RPCs should be protected by NACM {{RFC8341}} to limit the extraction of attestation data by only authorized Verifiers.

For the YANG module ietf-tcg-algs.yang, please use care when selecting specific algorithms.  The introductory section of {{TCG-Algos}} highlights that some algorithms should be considered legacy, and recommends implementers and adopters diligently evaluate available information such as governmental, industrial, and academic research before selecting an algorithm for use.
